<h2>1.He isn't as bad as people think</h2>
<p>
    Looks i know how people used to think rocket healing suck but they did buff heal to heal for 50hp when he hit his glowing balls directly. Also his old ult wasn't that bad <b><em>you guys just suck 30% damage boost is no joke, it's not my fault you guys can't aim.</em></b>
</p>
<h2>His skill are great</h2>
<ul type="square">
    <li>He can crawl on wall which make him highly moble.</li>
    <li>His dash was nerf because it was too good just so you know.</li>
    <li>Free revive so unless your dps keep dying it's like his best ability</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.His stats are ok i guess</h2>  
<table border="1">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Health</th>
            <th>Ammo</th>
            <th>Orbs</th>
        </tr>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>250</td>
                <td>45</td>
                <td>8</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </thead>
</table>
<p>But he is a smol boi so he is hard to hit in the heat of combat.</p>
